Hello! I’m Dylan Spille, an automation consultant and cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to helping businesses enhance their operations through innovative automation solutions.

## My Current Role
I’m currently working as a **Consulting Systems Engineer (CSE)**, specializing in automation and cybersecurity. I enjoy diving deep into technology to create streamlined workflows that empower teams and secure operations. Working with Fortinet products like FortiSOAR has allowed me to support organizations in building responsive, efficient systems that adapt to the complex demands of cybersecurity.

## Personal Life
Beyond the tech world, I have some exciting personal news—I'm engaged and getting married in April 2025! My partner and I are looking forward to celebrating this new chapter with our friends and family, and it’s an incredibly joyful and memorable time in my life.

## Interests
When I’m not immersed in cybersecurity and automation projects, you’ll often find me exploring the outdoors, playing video games, reading up on the latest technology trends, or planning the next big adventure. I believe in a balanced life where continuous learning and meaningful personal experiences go hand in hand.
